        <p>
          To address the problem faced by Nova Plumbing Solutions, the methodology of sales and operation planning, was followed.

        <section class="intro">
          <p>The methodology of sales and operation planning, also known as
            aggregate production planning in the Industrial Engineering domain, was followed. The reason for
            this choice was that the problem was stemming not from operational matters but from the lack of
            high-level monitoring. According to Chopra and Meindl, such a planning approach deals with the
            capacity decisions and presents volumes as well as the mixture for future production
          <p>
            The steps that were taken in this project to come up with such a plan consisted mostly of
            formulating and solving a linear programming model which was followed by the analysis of
            outputs. Of course, the LP model required estimation of some parameters. In terms of estimation
            effort, the tasks were separated as:
          </p>
          <ol class="circle"> 
            <li>Forecasting the future demand for the planning horizon</li>
            <li>Estimation of other parameters</li>
          </ol>
          <p>

            Aggregate production plans generally cover 3 to 18 months into the future. For the
            scope of this project, a planning horizon of 12 months was regarded as a reasonable choice.
            Thorough analyses were conducted for this time period. For the sake of sustainability and
            flexibility, a capacity planning tool was decided to be delivered to the company. Steps that were
            taken through the course of the project is summarized in the Figure.
